# Content Detection and Analysis for File Type Detection

#####Project Description
JPL and USC under the direction of Dr. Mattmann have worked to collect a corpus of “deep web” polar datasets spanning many file types, scientific data, images, videos, and other information on the Web. These pieces of data were collected using Apache Nutch, Apache Tika, and Apache Solr.

Right now, though the data has been collected, it has not been synthesized into a core website allowing Deep Search - ultimately the goal of this project is to construct such a web site using modern information retrieval technologies including Nutch, Tika and Solr, along with Banana, Facetview, and D3.js. The goal is to create http://polar.usc.edu and to use this website to demonstrate value to the NSF, to USC, and to NASA.
